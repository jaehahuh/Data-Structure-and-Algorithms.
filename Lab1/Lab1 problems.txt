1. Write a function that takes an array A and a number S and find if there are three numbers in A that sum to S.

Ex)Input : A = [1,2,4,6,9] ; S = 5
output : 1,2,2




2. Write a function that accepts as parameters an array A and a number S and finds if there is a continuous subarray of A that sums to S.

Ex)Input : A = [3,1,7,-2,4] ; S = 6
output : 1,7,-2



class : person()



3.Write a function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into one sored array.

Ex) Input : [1,3,5,6], [1,2,3,4,7]
Output : [1,1,2,3,3,4,5,6,7]



4.Array search
Given a sorted and a number, find the number in the array.

Ex) input: [1,3,4,7,9]. 7
output : 3
